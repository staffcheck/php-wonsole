Version 1.2 (22 December 2009)

PHP Wonsole was created by Christian Davén in 2009 and is
intended as a replacement for creating temporary PHP files
to try out or debug some PHP command or function.

You enter your PHP code into your web browser. The code
is then sent to the web server, stored in a file and executed.
The output and a variable dump is returned to the browser.

Your code snippets history is also stored in a cookie, so
that you can try different approaches and "undo" by selecting
a previous version of your code.

===========================================================
Requirements
===========================================================

PHP Wonsole requires a local Apache web server, running PHP 5
or later.

Most modern web browsers are supported, but if you're using
Internet Explorer, you'll get a crippled version of PHP Wonsole.
